# 🌟 About Me  
I am a **Computer Science Graduate Student at the University of Colorado Denver**, specializing in **Machine Learning, NLP, and Cloud Data Engineering**.  
My engineering approach focuses on designing **scalable ML pipelines**, **intelligent conversational systems**, and **production-ready data workflows**.

What sets me apart?  
I bring together **software engineering discipline**, **data engineering efficiency**, and **AI-driven problem solving** to build systems that work *not just in theory, but in the real world*.

I’ve engineered automotive software at **Tata Elxsi**, automated ETL pipelines in **Azure**, built advanced NLP models, and led finance operations as a University Treasurer — proving versatility, precision, and leadership across domains.
